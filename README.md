In order to convert currency, you need to run app.py

Then go to the local server address http://127.0.0.1/5000
To check the correctness of the database download, you need to go to the address http://127.0.0.1/5000/debug

  If something like this is displayed:
{
  "base": "EUR",
  "rates_count": 170,
  "updated_at": "2025-06-11T11:59:54.051663"
}
So the database is loaded correctly
